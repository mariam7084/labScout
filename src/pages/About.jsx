                        Hi, Iâ€™m Mariam, the creator of LabScout.
                        <br />
                        The idea for LabScout started in the middle of a frustrating search. After spending hours sifting through countless university websites, repositories for program links and outdated program pages, I realized how fragmented and difficult the process of finding the right international research opportunities and applying to it was. It seemed like a lot of doors were closed simply because the information wasn't easy to find or because I got to know about a program after its deadline ;) <br />
                        <br />
                        In the summer of 2024, after days of scanning websites, I stumbled upon the KoÃ§ University Summer Research Program in Turkey. I applied, was accepted, and had an incredible experience there. That's why I'm making this platform. I believe that students who are passionate about research shouldn't have to navigate this maze alone.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        LabScout is my way of giving back and making the process simpler. My hope is to build the tool I wish I had, and Iâ€™m dedicated to keeping it a reliable, student-focused resource. I'm excited to see how this project helps you on your own research journey.
                        <br />
                        You can find me below :)
